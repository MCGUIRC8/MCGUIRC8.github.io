                <div class="custom-div">
                    <p>My name is Christian McGuire, I am currently an Aerospace Engineering undergraduate at the University of Florida. I am interested in getting involved in experiential learning; be it through an internship, research, design project, or a lab setting. I am open to exploring and diversifying my interests in aerospace technologies, material science, and professional development through opportunities within and outside of the university.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Arduino Gas Meter</h3>
            <p>To solve the unreliability of my factory gas gauge –float getting stuck, fluid slosh in turns, corroded grounds– I designed a fuel metering system that would provide me a digital display of my remaining gallons to the hundredth. Using a micro hall effect meter inserted into the rubber line of my fuel tank, an Arduino Uno would calibrate, calculate, and display the remaining fuel on a SSD.</p>
            <p>•	Challenges: Had to learn coding; develop a system to store data after power is cut; locating the radio constant voltage wire; fuel line restriction; display switch; integration into the wiring harness</p>
            <h3>RC Aircraft</h3>
            <p>Designed, built, trimmed, and flew my own foamboard aircraft. Learned the basics of radio frequencies, electrical components required for flight –servo motors, ESC, brushless motors, recievers–, and the basics of aircraft design and proportions. Fostering my interest in aerospace and small scale systems.</p>
            <p>•	Challenges: Manufacturing accuracy and build quality; understanding CG, chord ratio, counter torque correction, exponentiation of input / output relationship; pilot skills</p>
